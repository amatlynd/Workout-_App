Sprint retrospective meeting:

Scribe appointed:

--Nick Lojas

Observations about sprint 3:

In order to catch up and get us back on track for finishing by the project due date, we decided to work on two user stories this sprint - "Add Workouts" and "Add exercises to a workout". We also met up more often over skype and in-person to overcome any obstacles and to discuss our progress.

This worked much better and seemed to go smoother than the last sprint, seems as if the extra communication allowed for the sprint to be completed and for us to get back on track easier.


Participants in the meeting:

--Lyndon Amat

--Nick Lojas

--Arman Ghassemi

--Esther Itimi-elo

--Mohamed Kazem

Unfinished Tasks (made into stories):

- Login with google

As a user, I want to login into the app using my google account.

Practices to continue for sprint 4:

Communicating between group members more often through our facebook group chat. Planning meetings to check up on progress. Planning ahead and helping each other out with issues.

New practises to introduce for sprint 4:

Watch and read more tutorials on databases since those seem to be our weak point. Evenly distributing the work between all members of the team.

Practises to stop using for sprint 4:

When we get stuck on a certain problem, instead of trying to fix that problem first and losing time, we should move on to complete the other tasks to be done, then come back and fix the problems as a team.

Best experience during sprint 3:

When the workouts showed up under the corresponding user in the database.

Worst experience during sprint 3:

Arman and Mohammed conflicting workout and exercise pages and one of them was forced to change the code to go along with the other page. Problem with coordination.
