For this part, each member should write a very short report that answers the following items:

 * What is your most significant individual contribution?
 	- Implementing the validation for the email and password fields of the login page using pattern and matcher java imports.

 * Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
 	- Firebase was definitely a good technical concept that I learned which will be useful in future app development. It also helped me learn a bit about databases which I had no prior experience with before the project.

 * What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
 	- I show up to all meetings and I like to help out when someone asks for it. (such as trying to fix bugs)

 * What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
  	- I tend to procrastinate which makes me get less work done than others that spread their share of work out throughout the sprint. In the future, I should assign myself more tasks and start them earlier to be able not worry about bugs that come up.

Please keep it short - You should answer each item in 1-3 sentences.
