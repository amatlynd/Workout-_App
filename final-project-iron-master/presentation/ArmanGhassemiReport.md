 * What is your most significant individual contribution?
 	I'm most proud of the UI work I did, more specifically the login page.
  There was a steep learning curve as I had to go over the whole material design documentation a few times. 
  Also, there were times I realized I messed up and had to redesign.
  UI/UX has always been a struggle for me but now I'm confident in creating my own UI for other android apps I'll be craeting in the future.
 	

 * Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
 		I learned the how to implement Android's recycler view. I found this idea so interesting that I took it upon myself to learn the inner workings
    and algorithms associated with it. 
    At my previous workplace we had to implement a fluid and efficient scrolling mechanism and now after learning about caching and recycling views I feel like this would have been the best solution at that time.

 * What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
  My main strengths are not being afraid to break things and communicating with other team members jumping on their tasks with them if I finish mine early.
  In regards to breaking things, early on we had problems with firebase, and we weren't making progress to fixing the bug so I insisted in deleting the project and going over the steps again. Turned out we did miss something in the setup.
  Also, I realize the sprint isn't over once my tasks are done, there is always other work so I tried my best in learning what other members we're doing and pairing with them to complete the tasks.

 * What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
  Communication is both my strength and my weakness. Though I communicate with others to help them out, I don't communicate as much what I'm doing.
  It would have helped if I commented my code more and perhaps be more active in updating my team mates in what I've done. Rather than giving huge status updates.
