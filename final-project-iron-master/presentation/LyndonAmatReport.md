What is your most significant individual contribution?
------------------------------------------------------
- My most significant contribution is the database implementation of saving, reading, writing into the database, basically the backend
- With Esther we also worked together using paired programming in functionalities such as linking pages
- Responsible for designing the logo

Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Asynchornous calls in event listeners for real time databases caused major problems for checking if
  something exists or changing variables inside the event listeners
 - A solution was to use callback functions so the synchronization of the event listeners were fixed
 - Was not implemented because of the lack of time

What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
-----------------------------------------------
- My main strength as a team member is helping out the other team member as they debug helping the progress of the group.

What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- My main weakness as a team member is collaboration with certain team members
- For example, Arman and I both worked on google and facebook loginstogether but when we both worked remotely there was 
  confusion on who was working on what and so we had two implementations of the logins which was not efficient
 - I could improve by communicating better by clarifying what needed to be done.
