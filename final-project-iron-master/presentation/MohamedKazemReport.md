 * What is your most significant individual contribution?
 	
 	The work that I put in for the workouts page and the "adding a workout" dialog box would be the most significant contribution that I made. I made the page in XML and implemented the Java code portion of the workout page and dialog box. Getting this to work and looking up how to do it took a large amount of time. While not all of what I did ended up in the final product, it helped us get started and helped Arman develop his version, which is what we ended up going with for both the workouts and workout page in order to have a consistent UI. 

 * Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
 		
	I really liked the concept of using Firebase in order to make logging in much easier on the back-end. Once we found out about Firebase, we wished that we had found out about it earlier because it simplifies the code and takes care of email, Facebook, and Google+ logins. It's also capable of being used as a full database and this is what we did. We stored our objects into and it and was nice to have one central application that took care of everything. 

 * What is your main strength(s) as a team member?

 	I think my main strength is that I am hardworking and that I will spend as long as something takes in order for me to complete it. I do not like to submit incomplete work and at times of this project I spent much longer that I had budgeted for on certain things in order to make sure they were done well. 

 * What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

 	I could improve by working more collaboratively with my team mates. Rather than trying to create the workouts page alone, if I had worked with Arman on it together then we could have saved lots of time and reduced code redundancies. Also, I would have benefited if I had thought about the structure of the code more in advance so that we could have made the code more modular and reusable.
