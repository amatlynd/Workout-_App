	What worked well for us was working in close contact in an open space. For example, we’d agree to meet at a certain time and we’d develop together. This was great for communication because we could easily pair program and ask each other questions. We’ve all pair programmed with one another at some point, which is great. Another great thing was making use of a Facebook group chat to keep each other updated on what we’ve done and post useful links. We were very strict with Material Design Practices and followed everything by the book, which in turn made our app look amazing. This is also a great practice for industry app development.


	What could have been done better is being transparent. This includes letting each other know when we are stuck, being clear about the state of our tasks, arguing. By arguing we mean, each team member doing research about technologies to use then coming up with points about why X is better than Y.


	If we had to continue working as a team we’d be stricter about testing. The project is already at the point where if something breaks it get’s hard to find out where. Or if something that was working is now, breaking, it may go unnoticed. 


	An ideal process would be everyone being transparent. Writing unit tests, tests between components, and end-to-end UI tests. We’d have gradle/maven tasks to clean build everything and run all tests. Also some form of continuous integration like Jenkins. And overall thinking about the technology we are using and how to make our code more scalable. This process as a whole would seem like we aren’t doing much development work because most of the process will be testing and planning. But in the long run, we’d be more efficient.
