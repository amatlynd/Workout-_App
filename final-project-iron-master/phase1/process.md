 - On Friday February 17th we met at a room in deerfield to understand the flow and decide on required tools we need to develop the app we have in mind.
 - We made use of a white board and marker to write suggestions of features of the app we want and might need.

 - We made decisions by looking at complexity of the task and rank accordingly.
 - We also had some discussions on facebook group chat.

 - Lessons learnt:
  - Do not procrastinate.
  - Always ask questions do not assume that an issue is taken care of without verification.
  - Always keep in touch with partners, hence the need to communicate on group chats and attend meetings.
